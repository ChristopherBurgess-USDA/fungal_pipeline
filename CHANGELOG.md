# nf-core/fungal_pipeline: Changelog

## 2025-12-12

### `Added`

- Added in itxpress module using `nf-core module create` function. Paired end reads are hard coded in so it will break when non paired in reads are used.
- Removed a lot of the TODOs generated from `nf-core workflows create` was used as it really isn't neccessary for this demo.

### `Deprecated`

- Removed calls for old modules I wrote for my original practice
